# v2

- add capacitive PAD on the bottom
- use the left ADC input for 2 extra pots
- remove one effect from first band isolator fx to free up one extra knob
  - so now we have 3 knobs left for a second band isolator: mix, freq, range + kaospad
  - pad let use defining the amount of the 2 effect from the second band isolator using X/Y
- might need a switch to hold fx
